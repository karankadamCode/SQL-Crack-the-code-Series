#Problem Description :
Find the number of Apple product users and the number of total users with a device and group the counts by language. 
Assume Apple products are only MacBook-Pro, iPhone 5s, and iPad-air. Output the language along with the total number 
of Apple users and users with any device. Order your results based on the number of total users in descending order.


Table: playbook_events
      user_id:int
      occurred_at:datetime
      event_type:varchar
      event_name:varchar
      location:varchar
      device:varchar

Table: playbook_users
      user_id:int
      created_at:datetime
      company_id:int
      language:varchar
      activated_at:datetime
      state:varchar

Expected Output:
language	n_apple_user	n_total_users
english	           11	          45
spanish      	3	           9
japanese	      2	           6
french	      0	           5
russian	      0	           5


#Solution Approach :
        1.	The query retrieves data from two tables, "playbook_events" (aliased as "pe") and "playbook users" (aliased as "pu"), 
        using an inner join based on the "user_id" column to combine the information.
        2.	The results are grouped by the "language" column from the "playbook_users" table to analyze user data based on different languages.
        3.	For each language group, it counts the number of unique users who used specific Apple devices ("macbook pro," "iphone 5s," and "ipad air") 
        and stores the count as "n_apple_users."
        4.	Additionally, it calculates the total number of unique users in each language group and stores the count as "n_total_users."
        5.	The final result is sorted in descending order based on the "n_total_users" count to showcase the languages with the highest number of 
        total users at the top.

#Solution :
      SELECT
          pu.language,
          COUNT(DISTINCT
                CASE 
                  WHEN pe.device IN ('macbook pro','iphone 5s','ipad air')
                  THEN pe.user_id ELSE NULL
                END) AS n_apple_users,
          COUNT(DISTINCT pe.user_id) AS n_total_users
      FROM playbook_events AS pe 
      JOIN playbook_users AS pu 
      ON pe.user_id = pu.user_id
      GROUP BY pu.language
      ORDER BY n_total_users DESC
