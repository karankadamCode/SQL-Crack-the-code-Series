Problem 1: Number of Units Per Nationality
Asked in: Airbnb 
Difficulty: Medium

Description:
Find the number of apartments per nationality that are owned by people under 30 years old.
Output the nationality along with the number of apartments.
Sort records by the apartments count in descending order.

Solution Approach: 
       Start by joining the "airbnb_hosts" table (aliased as 'a') with the "airbnb_units" table 
      (aliased as 'b') based on the common column 'host_id'. 
       Filter the results by selecting only rows where 'unit_type' is 'Apartment' and the 
      host's 'age' is less than 30. 
       Use the 'COUNT (DISTINCT b.unit_id)' function to count the distinct 'unit_id's for 
      each nationality. 
       Group the results by 'nationality' using the 'GROUP BY' clause to get counts for each 
      nationality. 
       Sort the results in descending order of 'cnt' (count) using the 'ORDER BY cnt DESC' 
      clause to find the nationalities with the highest number of 'Apartment' units hosted 
      by individuals under 30 years old.

Solution: 
        SELECT 
         a.nationality, 
         COUNT(DISTINCT b.unit_id) AS cnt
        FROM airbnb_hosts AS a 
        JOIN airbnb_units AS b 
        ON a.host_id = b.host_id
        WHERE b.unit_type = 'Apartment' AND a.age < 30
        GROUP BY a.nationality
        ORDER BY cnt DESC

Problem 2: New Products
Asked in: Salesforce, Tesla
Difficulty: Medium

Description:
You are given a table of product launches by company by year. Write a query to count the net difference between the number of 
products companies launched in 2020 with the number of products companies launched in the previous year. Output the name of the 
companies and a net difference of net products released for 2020 compared to the previous year.


Solution Approach: 
       Create two subqueries, `2019_results` and `2020_results`, to calculate the product 
      counts for each company in the 'car_launches' table separately for the years 2019 
      and 2020. 
       In the `2019_results` CTE, select 'company_name' and count the 'product_name's for 
      the year 2019, grouping the results by 'company_name'. 
       In the `2020_results` CTE, select 'company_name' and count the 'product_name's for 
      the year 2020, grouping the results by 'company_name'. 
       Combine the results of the two CTE’s using the main query. Join the `2019_results` 
      table (aliased as 'a') with the `2020_results` table (aliased as 'b') based on the 
      common column 'company_name'. 
       In the main query, calculate the difference between the product counts of 2020 and 
      2019 for each company using the expression `(b.product_count_2020 - 
      a.product_count_2019)` and alias it as 'total_launch'. 
       The final output will display the company name along with the difference in product 
      counts between 2020 and 2019 for each company. 

Solution: 
      WITH 2019_results AS(
      SELECT 
       company_name, 
       COUNT(product_name) AS product_count_2019
      FROM car_launches
      WHERE year = 2019
      GROUP BY company_name
      ),2020_results AS(
      SELECT 
       company_name, 
       COUNT(product_name) AS product_count_2020
      FROM car_launches
      WHERE year = 2020
      GROUP BY company_name)

      SELECT 
       a.company_name, 
       (b.product_count_2020 - a.product_count_2019) AS total_launch
      FROM 2019_results AS a 
      JOIN 2020_results AS b 
      ON a.company_name = b.company_nam
